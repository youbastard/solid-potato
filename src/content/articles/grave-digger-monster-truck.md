**Grave Digger** is a [monster truck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monster_truck "Monster truck") racing team in the Feld Entertainment Monster Jam series founded by original driver [Dennis Anderson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennis_Anderson "Dennis Anderson"). \[It is] Considered one of the most famous and recognized monster trucks of all time.

There have been a total of 41 Grave Digger monster trucks built.

* Grave Digger #1 – The original truck was first built as a mud racing truck from a 1957 Ford pickup, then rebuilt as a true monster truck in 1985 using a 1951 Ford panel van body. The rebuilt version, nicknamed "Grandma", is on display at the Digger's Dungeon shop. A replica of the original configuration using parts saved from the rebuild was assembled to make an appearance at World Finals 8 in 2007 as part of a 25th anniversary celebration of Grave Digger. It is also on display at Digger's Dungeon.
* Grave Digger #2 – Built in 1989 from a 1950 Chevrolet panel van, which became the model for all subsequent Grave Digger bodies. The steel body was soon replaced by a fiberglass replica. It was heavily damaged in a crash that snapped its frame in late 1990, and retired from full-time competition. In 1994, parts, including the original steel body, were used to construct a special truck to allow Dennis Anderson to perform a water crossing charity stunt. Fully restored in 2016 by Adam Anderson using the original body, it is on display at Digger's Dungeon.
* Grave Digger #3 – Debuted in 1991. First truck to use a steel-tube-framed, four-link-suspension chassis. It was sold in late 1999. The truck is currently owned by Jimmy Durr and known as "Slag Hag".
* Grave Digger #4 – This truck was operated from 1991 to 1993 by Jack Koberna as part of a franchise agreement for West Coast events. It was built with a traditional frame and leaf-spring suspension chassis with a fiberglass body. After Koberna's franchise ended, Pablo Huffaker signed a similar deal, and used his second Jus' Show'N Off truck (a tube-framed truck built in 1991) with the body from #4. Huffaker drove it as Grave Digger from 1993 to 1995.
* Grave Digger #5 – Built in 1991 using a new frame with parts salvaged from #2, including the fiberglass replica body and leaf-spring suspension. It was only used until 1992, and it became a display truck. Parts were removed for the restoration of #2, and the frame was sold.
* Grave Digger #6 – Built in 1991 as the "Street Digger", a street-legal display truck. Parts were later used to build a mega truck that is now known as "Old Number Six".
  Grave Digger #7 – Debuted in 1992, extensively rebuilt in 1999, and retired in 2005. Currently on permanent display at Digger's Dungeon.
