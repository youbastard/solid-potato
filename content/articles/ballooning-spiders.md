**[Ballooning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballooning_\(spider\))**, sometimes called kiting, is a process by which spiders, and some other small invertebrates, move through the air by releasing one or more gossamer threads to catch the wind, causing them to become airborne at the mercy of air currents and potentially electric currents.
