A **cross sea** is a sea state of wind-generated ocean waves that form nonparallel wave systems. Cross seas have a large amount of directional spreading. This may occur when water waves from one weather system continue despite a shift in wind. Waves generated by the new wind run at an angle to the old.

This sea state is fairly common and a large percentage of ship accidents have been found to occur in this state. Vessels fare better against large waves when perpendicular to the waves. In a cross sea, vessels are more likely to be struck in a dangerous way.
