**Syncope**, also known as **fainting**, is a loss of [consciousness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consciousness "Consciousness") and muscle strength characterized by a fast onset, short duration, and spontaneous recovery. It is caused by a decrease in blood flow to the brain, typically from low blood pressure.

> It was fashionable for women to affect an aristocratic frailty and create a scene by fainting at a dramatic moment.
