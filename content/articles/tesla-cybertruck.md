The **[Tesla Cybertruck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_Cybertruck)** is an all-electric, battery-powered, light commercial vehicle launched by Elon Muskâ€™s Tesla, Inc.

Despite successful drop tests conducted on a pane of the specialized 'Tesla armor glass' and a successful pre-show test where a steel ball was thrown at the windows of the truck itself by chief of design Franz von Holzhausen with apparently no damage, the windows were damaged when Holzhausen repeated the test during the show. Musk jokingly exclaimed that "the ball didn't make it through"
