**Pareidolia** is the tendency for [perception](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perception "Perception") to impose a meaningful interpretation on a nebulous [stimulus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulus_(physiology) "Stimulus (physiology)"), usually visual, so that one sees an object, pattern, or meaning where there is none.

Common examples are [perceived images](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud#In_culture_and_religion "Cloud") of animals, faces, or objects in cloud formations, seeing faces in inanimate objects, or [lunar pareidolia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_pareidolia "Lunar pareidolia") like the [Man in the Moon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man_in_the_Moon "Man in the Moon") or the [Moon rabbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon_rabbit "Moon rabbit"). The concept of pareidolia may extend to include [hidden messages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidden_message "Hidden message") in recorded music played in reverse or at higher- or lower-than-normal speeds, and hearing voices (mainly indistinct) or music in random noise, such as that produced by air conditioners or fans.
