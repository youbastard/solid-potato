The **[diving reflex]()**, also known as the [b]diving response[b] and [b]mammalian diving reflex[b], is a set of physiological responses to immersion that overrides the basic homeostatic reflexes, and is found in all air-breathing vertebrates studied to date. It optimizes respiration by preferentially distributing oxygen stores to the heart and brain, enabling submersion for an extended time.

## Therapeutic usage

The diving reflex is used in [Dialectical behavior therapy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialectical_behavior_therapy) as part of the "TIP" skill, to alleviate distress very quickly during a crisis and control physiology
