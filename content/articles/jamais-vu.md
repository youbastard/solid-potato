In psychology, **Jamais Vu**, a French borrowing meaning "never seen", is the phenomenon of experiencing a situation that one recognizes in some fashion, but that nonetheless seems novel and unfamiliar.

Jamais vu is most commonly experienced when a person momentarily does not recognise a word or, less commonly, a person or place, that they know. This can be achieved by anyone by [repeatedly writing or saying a specific word out loud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_satiation). After a few seconds one will often, despite knowing that it is a real word, feel as if "there's no way it is an actual word".

> A study by Chris Moulin of Leeds University asked 92 volunteers to write out "door" 30 times in 60 seconds. In July 2006 at the 4th International Conference on Memory in Sydney he reported that 68 percent of volunteers showed symptoms of jamais vu, such as beginning to doubt that "door" was a real word. Dr Moulin believes that a similar brain fatigue underlies a phenomenon observed in some schizophrenia patients: that a familiar person has been replaced by an impostor. Dr Moulin suggests they could be suffering from chronic jamais vu
