The **IKEA effect** is a [cognitive bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_bias) in which [consumers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer) place a disproportionately high value on products they partially created. The name refers to [Swedish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden) manufacturer and furniture retailer [IKEA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IKEA), which sells many [items of furniture that require assembly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ready-to-assemble_furniture).

A 2011 study found that subjects were willing to pay 63% more for furniture they had assembled themselves, than for equivalent pre-assembled items.
