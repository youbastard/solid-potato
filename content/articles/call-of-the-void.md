When someone who has not shown a history of suicidal ideation experiences a sudden and pronounced thought of performing an act which would necessarily lead to their own death, psychologists call this an intrusive thought. A commonly experienced example of this is the high place phenomenon, also referred to as the **Call of the Void**. The urge to jump is called "mountain fever" in Brian Biggs' book, *Dear Julia*.

Euphemisms related to mortal contemplation include internal struggle, voluntary death, and eating one's gun.
