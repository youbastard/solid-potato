- [Prosciutto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosciutto)

  When I was young, there was one kind of prosciutto. It was made in the winter, by hand, and aged for two years. It was sweet when you smelled it. A profound perfume. Unmistakable. To age a prosciutto is a subtle business. If it's too warm, the aging process never begins. The meat spoils. If it's too dry, the meat is ruined. It needs to be damp but cool. The summer is too hot. In the winter—that's when you make [salumi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salumi). Your prosciutto. Your [soppressata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soppressata). Your [sausages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sausage).

- False Vacuum - The possibility that we are living in a false vacuum has never been a cheering one to contemplate. Vacuum decay is the ultimate ecological catastrophe; in the new vacuum there are new constants of nature; after vacuum decay, not only is life as we know it impossible, so is chemistry as we know it. However, one could always draw stoic comfort from the possibility that perhaps in the course of time the new vacuum would sustain, if not life as we know it, at least some structures capable of knowing joy. This possibility has now been eliminated.

- In Sumerian mythology, the Tigris [river] was created by the god Enki, who ejaculated and filled the river with flowing water.

  **Zero to the power of zero**, denoted by **00**, is a [mathematical expression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expression_(mathematics)) with no agreed-upon [value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(mathematics)). The most common possibilities are [1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1#Mathematics) or leaving the expression undefined, with justifications existing for each, depending on context. In [algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebra) and [combinatorics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatorics), the generally agreed upon value is 00 = 1, whereas in [mathematical analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_analysis), the expression is sometimes left undefined. [Computer programs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero_to_the_power_of_zero#Treatment_on_computers) also have differing ways of handling this expression.

### Quotes



This lax pith or marrow in man's head shows no more capacity for thought than a cake of suet or a bowl of curds



Adam and Eve were heirs to natural bounty. They had everything they needed. But they sinned and were expelled. How did they sin? By challenging God's very omnipotence. In so doing they represented the agriculturists, the upstarts who insisted on taking matters into their own hands, relying upon their knowledge and their own skills rather than on His bounty.



a hundred million colors, with each familiar hue fracturing into a hundred more subtle shades for which there are no names



If we divide language development into somewhat arbitrary stages, like Syllable Babbling, Gibberish Babbling, One-Word Utterances, and Two-Word strings, the next stage would have to be called "All Hell Breaks Loose".



A rabbit scurries by, and a native shouts, "Gavagai!" What does "gavagai" mean? Logically speaking, it needn't be "rabbit." It could refer to that particular rabbit (Flopsy, for example). It could mean any furry thing, any mammal, or any member of that species of rabbit. It could mean the top half of a rabbit. It could mean a collection of undetached rabbit parts.



Moving a tranquilized bear is like moving a waterbed without a frame



how can you govern a country in which there are 246 kinds of cheese?

"I have seen things that have left a deep shadow on my mind"



Dr Strangelove - The whole point of the Doomsday Machine is lost if you keep it a secret.



"The story [of Back to the Future] is told from the point of view of the Delorean, being that it is the only consistent time traveler. During time travel, it picked up some manner of sentience, not unlike the Event Horizon. It doesn't make sense because it is a car and isn't very smart or good at telling stories."



Surprisingly often, the answer to these decision problems is "it cannot be done at all", or "it is extremely expensive" (with a precise characterization of how expensive exactly).



If you see a person reaching for a jar of cookies, you might assume that he wants a cookie (even if you know the jar is empty).
