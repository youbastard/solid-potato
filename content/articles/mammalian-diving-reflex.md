The **diving reflex**, also known as the **diving response** and **mammalian diving reflex**, is a set of physiological responses to immersion that overrides the basic homeostatic reflexes, and is found in all air-breathing vertebrates studied to date. It optimizes respiration by preferentially distributing oxygen stores to the heart and brain, enabling submersion for an extended time.

## Therapeutic usage
