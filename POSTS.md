  **Prosciutto** ([/prəˈʃuːtoʊ, proʊˈ-/](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/English) [*prə-SHOO-toh, proh-*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Pronunciation_respelling_key),[[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosciutto#cite_note-1)[[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosciutto#cite_note-2)[[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosciutto#cite_note-3)[[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosciutto#cite_note-4) Italian: [[proʃˈʃutto\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/Italian))[[5\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosciutto#cite_note-5) is an [Italian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_cuisine) [dry-cured ham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dry-cured_ham) that is usually thinly sliced and served uncooked; this style is called ***prosciutto crudo\*** in Italian (or simply ***crudo\***) and is distinguished from cooked ham, [*prosciutto cotto*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosciutto_cotto).

  

  

  When I was young, there was one kind of prosciutto. It was made in the winter, by hand, and aged for two years. It was sweet when you smelled it. A profound perfume. Unmistakable. To age a prosciutto is a subtle business. If it's too warm, the aging process never begins. The meat spoils. If it's too dry, the meat is ruined. It needs to be damp but cool. The summer is too hot. In the winter—that's when you make [salumi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salumi). Your prosciutto. Your [soppressata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soppressata). Your [sausages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sausage).[[10\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosciutto#cite_note-10)

However, one could always draw stoic comfort from the possibility that perhaps in the course of time the new vacuum would sustain, if not life as we know it, at least some structures capable of knowing joy. This possibility has now been eliminated.

  **Zero to the power of zero**, denoted by **00**, is a [mathematical expression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expression_(mathematics)) with no agreed-upon [value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(mathematics)). The most common possibilities are [1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1#Mathematics) or leaving the expression undefined, with justifications existing for each, depending on context. In [algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebra) and [combinatorics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatorics), the generally agreed upon value is 00 = 1, whereas in [mathematical analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_analysis), the expression is sometimes left undefined. [Computer programs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero_to_the_power_of_zero#Treatment_on_computers) also have differing ways of handling this expression.

### Quotes



This lax pith or marrow in man's head shows no more capacity for thought than a cake of suet or a bowl of curds



Adam and Eve were heirs to natural bounty. They had everything they needed. But they sinned and were expelled. How did they sin? By challenging God's very omnipotence. In so doing they represented the agriculturists, the upstarts who insisted on taking matters into their own hands, relying upon their knowledge and their own skills rather than on His bounty.



a hundred million colors, with each familiar hue fracturing into a hundred more subtle shades for which there are no names



If we divide language development into somewhat arbitrary stages, like Syllable Babbling, Gibberish Babbling, One-Word Utterances, and Two-Word strings, the next stage would have to be called "All Hell Breaks Loose".



A rabbit scurries by, and a native shouts, "Gavagai!" What does "gavagai" mean? Logically speaking, it needn't be "rabbit." It could refer to that particular rabbit (Flopsy, for example). It could mean any furry thing, any mammal, or any member of that species of rabbit. It could mean the top half of a rabbit. It could mean a collection of undetached rabbit parts.



Moving a tranquilized bear is like moving a waterbed without a frame



how can you govern a country in which there are 246 kinds of cheese?



the chances of finding something psychotic and hateful in a Scrabble factory explosion are hovering just around 100 percent



every base is base 10



"I have seen things that have left a deep shadow on my mind"



Dr Strangelove - The whole point of the Doomsday Machine is lost if you keep it a secret.



"The story [of Back to the Future] is told from the point of view of the Delorean, being that it is the only consistent time traveler. During time travel, it picked up some manner of sentience, not unlike the Event Horizon. It doesn't make sense because it is a car and isn't very smart or good at telling stories."



Surprisingly often, the answer to these decision problems is "it cannot be done at all", or "it is extremely expensive" (with a precise characterization of how expensive exactly).



If you see a person reaching for a jar of cookies, you might assume that he wants a cookie (even if you know the jar is empty).







**Ray Caldwell**https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_Caldwell

**Raymond Benjamin Caldwell** (April 26, 1888 – August 17, 1967) was an American [Major league](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball) [pitcher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitcher) from 1910 to 1921. He was known for throwing the [spitball](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spitball), and he was one of the 17 pitchers allowed to continue throwing the pitch after it was outlawed in 1920.



Caldwell was notorious during his playing career for his addiction to alcohol and partying; he possessed a self-destructive streak that many of his contemporaries believed stopped him from reaching his potential. In 1924, [Miller Huggins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miller_Huggins) wrote: 'Caldwell was one of the best pitchers that ever lived, but he was one of those characters that keep a manager in a constant worry. If he had possessed a sense of responsibility and balance, Ray Caldwell would have gone down in history as one of the greatest of all pitchers.' 



**Yet, despite his achievements on the field and his antics off it, Caldwell is perhaps best remembered for being struck by** [**lightning**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightning) **while playing for the** [**Cleveland Indians**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Indians) **against the** [**Philadelphia Athletics**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_Athletics) **in 1919; remarkably, despite being knocked unconscious, he refused to leave the game, having pitched 82⁄3 innings, and went on to record the final out for the win.**
