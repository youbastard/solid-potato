**[Kraft Singles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kraft_Singles)** is a processed cheese product manufactured and sold by Kraft Foods, introduced in 1949. Kraft individually wrapped "slices" are not really slices off a block, but formed separately in manufacturing. Kraft singles do however contain ingredients in common with cheddar cheese.
