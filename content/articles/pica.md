Pica - Pica is a medical disorder characterized by an appetite for substances largely non-nutritive foods e.g. metal [coins, etc.], clay, coal, soil, feces, chalk, paper, soap, mucus, ash, gum, etc.) The term originates from the Latin word pica ("magpie"), a bird that is famed for its unusual eating behaviors, where it is known to eat almost anything.

In order for these actions to be considered pica, they must persist for more than one month at an age when eating such objects is considered developmentally inappropriate, not part of culturally sanctioned practice, and sufficiently severe to warrant clinical attention.
