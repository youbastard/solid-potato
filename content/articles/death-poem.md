The **death poem** is a genre of poetry that developed in the literary traditions of East Asian cultures — most prominently in Japan as well as certain periods of Chinese history and Joseon Korea. They tend to offer a reflection on death — both in general and concerning the imminent death of the author — that is often coupled with a meaningful observation on life.
