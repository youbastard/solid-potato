A **[cross sea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross_sea)** is a sea state of wind-generated ocean waves that form nonparallel wave systems. Cross seas have a large amount of directional spreading. This may occur when water waves from one weather system continue despite a shift in wind. Waves generated by the new wind run at an angle to the old.

This sea state is fairly common and a large percentage of ship accidents have been found to occur in this state.[3] Vessels fare better against large waves when perpendicular to the waves. In a cross sea, vessels are more likely to be struck in a dangerous way.
