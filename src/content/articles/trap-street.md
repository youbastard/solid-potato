In [cartography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartography "Cartography"), a **trap street** is a [fictitious entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fictitious_entry "Fictitious entry") in the form of a misrepresented [street](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Street "Street") on a [map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Map "Map"), often outside the area the map nominally covers, for the purpose of "trapping" potential [copyright](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright "Copyright") violators of the map who, if caught, would be unable to explain the inclusion of the "trap street" on their map as innocent. On maps that are not of streets, other "copyright trap" features (such as [nonexistent towns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phantom_settlement "Phantom settlement"), or mountains with the wrong elevations) may be inserted or altered for the same purpose.



Trap streets are not copyrightable under the federal law of the [United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States "United States"). In *Nester's Map & Guide Corp. v. Hagstrom Map Co.* (1992),[](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trap_street#cite_note-3) a United States federal court found that copyright traps are not themselves protectable by [copyright](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright "Copyright"). There, the court stated: "\[t]o treat 'false' facts interspersed among actual facts and represented as actual facts as fiction would mean that no one could ever reproduce or copy actual facts without risk of reproducing a false fact and thereby violating a copyright ... If such were the law, information could never be reproduced or widely disseminated."
